## 12. KNOWN GAPS & NEXT STEPS

| Gap | Detail |
|-----|--------|
| **hreflang** | No `en-GB` / `en-US` / `x-default` alternate links; UK-focused site may not need en-US, but spec mentioned it |
| **BreadcrumbList JSON-LD on hub/utility pages** | `/regions`, `/countries`, `/expertise-areas`, `/case-types`, `/guides`, `/fees`, `/what-is`, `/qualifications`, `/services` lack `PageJsonLd` |
| **Route count vs brief** | 58 content routes + technical routes; brief cited 62 — likely includes deprecated or planned pages |
| **Southern Africa region → guides** | No direct `/guides/` link in `regionRelatedLinks` (glossary anchor only) |
| **Glossary search query param** | WebSite SearchAction targets `/glossary?q=` but glossary filter is client-side only (no SSR search results page) |
| **Expert profiles** | `/experts` shows 3 illustrative experts; not a full directory CMS |
| **54 vs 62 African countries** | Marketing copy references 54 countries; only 12 dedicated country landing pages built |
| **Middleware deprecation warning** | Next.js 16 warns `middleware.ts` convention deprecated in favour of `proxy` |
| **Duplicate sitemap sources** | Both `public/sitemap.xml` (prebuild script) and `app/sitemap.ts` exist; keep in sync via `npm run seo:verify` |
| **Playwright responsive tests** | `npm run test:responsive` available; not wired to CI by default |
| **Experts removed from navbar** | `/experts` page exists but not in main nav (by design) |
